Tactic: Defense Evasion\\n- Technique: Security Software Discovery (T1063)\\n- Verification: Verify that the workstation has security software installed and that it is capable of detecting and preventing unauthorized access attempts. Attempt to bypass the security software and verify that it generates an alert or blocks the attempt.\\n\\n3. Tactic: Discovery\\n- Technique: Network Service Scanning (T1046)\\n- Verification: Conduct a network scan to identify the services running on the workstation. If multifactor authentication is enabled, verify that the services require multifactor authentication to access.\\n\\n4. Tactic: Lateral Movement\\n- Technique: Pass the Hash (T1075)\\n- Verification: Attempt to pass the hash of a previously compromised workstation to gain access to the target workstation. If multifactor authentication is enabled, verify that the pass the hash attempt is unsuccessful.\\n\\n5. Tactic: Privilege Escalation\\n- Technique: Exploitation for Privilege Escalation (T1068)\\n- Verification: Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system to gain elevated privileges on the workstation. If multifactor authentication is enabled, verify that the exploit attempt is unsuccessful.\\n\\nThese verification steps can be used to ensure that the workstation running Windows is compliant with the IEC62443 Framework control SR 1.1 RE 2 for multifactor authentication for untrusted networks.\",\n",
